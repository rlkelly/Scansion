# Scansion
Poetry Meter Exploration Utilizing a parsed dictionary and NLTK


The purpose of this project is to explore the art of scansion utilizing NLTK.  Special thanks to the extremely informative 'The Poet's Craft Book' by Clement Wood.


Scansion is the natural movement of language in poetic form.  The goal of this project is to recommend the appropriate speech pattern when given a work of poetry.
